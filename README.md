ü™ô OpenCred
A modern credit scoring platform designed for the new-age workforce.

The Problem
Traditional credit scoring systems are outdated. They rely heavily on formal loan and credit card histories, often excluding students, freelancers, gig workers, and recent graduates. This financial exclusion creates significant barriers, preventing millions of deserving individuals from accessing essential financial services like small loans, credit cards, and other opportunities for growth.

Our Solution
OpenCred is an alternative credit scoring platform that provides a more equitable and accurate assessment of financial health. Instead of relying on traditional credit histories, our model analyzes spending patterns, income stability, and financial discipline derived from everyday transaction data.

This approach offers a holistic view of an individual's financial responsibility, empowering lenders to make fairer risk assessments and opening doors for the underbanked.

A Note on Data Simulation
For this hackathon MVP, we are using a sophisticated set of simulated bank transaction data. This allows us to demonstrate the power and accuracy of our credit scoring model without navigating the significant regulatory complexities associated with aggregating live financial data, which typically requires licensing and direct partnerships within the financial ecosystem. Our simulated data realistically mimics the transactional behavior of our target users.

‚ú® Key Features (MVP)
Secure User Authentication: Simple and secure sign-up and login functionality.

Dynamic Credit Scoring: A proprietary algorithm that processes transactional data to generate an alternative credit score.

Insightful Dashboard: A clean, user-friendly interface to display the calculated credit score.

Score Factor Analysis: Provides users with clear, understandable reasons behind their score, highlighting both positive financial habits and areas for improvement.

Income vs. Expense Visualization: A simple chart to help users understand their cash flow at a glance.
